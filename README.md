# monoengine
a custom 2D Game Engine built around the MonoGame framework

## Background
This a passion project that has evolved over the years and surprisingly turned into a decent 2D Game Engine. This all started as a gateway into computer programming after becoming addicted to Stardew Valley, and learning that the creator, ConcernedApe, built the game from the ground up using the XNA Framework. Fast forward a couple of years later, and I learned enough to make my own games from scratch too!
